<i><b> Biogeoscapes</b> - Ocean Metabolism and Nutrient Cycles on a Changing Planet</i><br>
<br>
In an effort to explore and develop international community interest for a potential future “Biogeotraces-like” program to study the microbial biological and chemical oceanography of the oceans, a working group of 28 scientists from 9 nations met in Woods Hole in November 2018. There was strong interest in continuing this effort among the international participants, who agreed to act as ambassadors to communicate these discussions to their respective national communities. Please join us in building community support for this effort. The workshop report is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Y3bK-B4oCKbaWhmlqFs9R2diw4TUYPA">here</a><br>
