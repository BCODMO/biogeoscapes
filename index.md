In an effort to explore and develop international community interest for a potential future “Biogeotraces-like” program to study the microbial biological and chemical oceanography of the oceans, a working group of 28 scientists from 9 nations met in Woods Hole in November 2018. There was strong interest in continuing this effort among the international participants, who agreed to act as ambassadors to communicate these discussions to their respective national communities. Please join us in building community support for this effort.

#### Upcoming Events
* <b>Organizing Intercalibration Efforts for BioGeoSCAPES: a Panel Discussion</b>. January 25 @ 11am-1pm EST. Overview: Producing data that can be effectively compared across space and time is a critical aspect to developing an international microbial biogeochemistry collaborative program. Intercalibration activities, involving validation of precision and accuracy and the development of intercomparison standards, are foundational to the production of interoperable data. With BioGeoSCAPES aiming to launch mid-decade further progress must be made to ensure high quality data collection. This virtual panel will hear perspectives from a variety of communities (nucleic acids, metabolomics, proteomics, rates) and encourage brainstorming through small group discussions. This panel discussion initiates the pre-work effort building towards an eventual in person BioGeoSCAPES workshop in the coming years. <b>Registration [link](https://whoi-edu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAocequrTotHtfPW_FUdqLnvTxKNPmlglHE)</b>
*	The Netherlands National workshop is occurring at the end of February, organized by Rob Middag and Susanne Wilken.
*	2nd Canada National Workshop: May 1-2, Halifax, organized by and Erin Bertrand and Maite Maldonado
